## Integration of APSystems inverters via ECU-R 
This adapter integrates [APSystems](https://apsystems.com/) inverters via APSystems ECU-R communication unit. 
The adapter queries the local ECU-R using the proprietary APSytems ECU to EMAapp protocol. It collects realtime information and history data about the ECU and about the configured inverters.
<br>
<br>
## Many Thanks ...
This project was only possible because of the great protocol analysis work of @checking12, @HAEdwin and other people on the home assistant forum. 
<br>
There exists also already a Python implementation for home assistant 
[ksheumaker/homeassistant-apsystems_ecur](https://github.com/ksheumaker/homeassistant-apsystems_ecur) which was used to get a better understanding of the  of the ECU behavior. 
<br>
<br>
## How it works todo
- ECU verbindung zur EMA cloude
- Locale communcation Ã¼ber TCP port 8899
- Cloude fake 
- ECU to Inverter Intervall 300sec
<br>
<br>
## Suported devices and services 

### Communication units:
- ECU-R - tested
- ECU-C - may work but not tested
- ECU-B (not clear)

### Inverters:
- QS1 - single device tested
- YC600 - not tested
- YC1000 - not tested
<br>
<br>
## Functions

* Implementation of all (known) services
  * *GetSystemInfo*, *GetRealTimeData*, *GetInverterData*, *GetPowerOfDay*, *GetEnergyOfWeekMonthYear*
  * Extraction and storing of all data offered by the services
<br>
<br>
* Cyclic request of realtime services *GetSystemInfo*, *GetRealTimeData* and *GetInverterSignalLevel*
  * Start/Stop of cyclic service execution by user
    * *cmd_start_stop*=true/false 
  * Cyclic requests are disabled between sunset and sunrise
    * Longitude and latitude from system configuration used 
<br>
<br>
* Calling of *GetPowerOfDay* service
  * Selectable day *power_of_day_date* for power data
  * Request once at adapter start
  * Request by user
    * *cmd_power_of_day*=true
    * *power_of_day_date* changed
<br>
<br>
* Calling of *GetEnergyOfWeekMonthYear* service 
  * Once at adapter start
  * Request by user
    * *cmd_energy_of_week*=true
    * *cmd_energy_of_month*=true
    * *cmd_energy_of_year*=true
<br>
<br>
* Supported Inverters
  * Several inverter types are in principle supported
  * But as of the limited availability ...
    * QS1 (only tests with one connected inverter)
    * YC600 (not tested)
    * YC1000 (not tested)
    * Extension of the test coverage with external support possible

## Remark
The ECU needs a working connection to the EMA claude. Without connection the ECU communication with inverters will not work.

## Developer manual
This section is intended for the developer. It can be deleted later

### Getting started

You are almost done, only a few steps left:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `ioBroker.apsystems-ecu`
1. Initialize the current folder as a new git repository:  
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
1. Link your local repository with the one on GitHub:  
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/npeter/ioBroker.apsystems-ecu
    ```

1. Push all files to the GitHub repo:  
    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```
1. Head over to [main.js](main.js) and start programming!

### Best Practices
We've collected some [best practices](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#development-and-coding-best-practices) regarding ioBroker development and coding in general. If you're new to ioBroker or Node.js, you should
check them out. If you're already experienced, you should also take a look at them - you might learn something new :)

### Scripts in `package.json`
Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `test:js`   | Executes the tests you defined in `*.test.js` files.     |
| `test:package`    | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files and your tests. |
| `lint` | Runs `ESLint` to check your code for formatting errors and potential bugs. |

### Writing tests
When done right, testing code is invaluable, because it gives you the 
confidence to change your code while knowing exactly if and when 
something breaks. A good read on the topic of test-driven development 
is https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92. 
Although writing tests before the code might seem strange at first, but it has very 
clear upsides.

The template provides you with basic tests for the adapter startup and package files.
It is recommended that you add your own tests into the mix.

### Publishing the adapter
Since you have chosen GitHub Actions as your CI service, you can 
enable automatic releases on npm whenever you push a new git tag that matches the form 
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. The necessary steps are described in `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`.

To get your adapter released in ioBroker, please refer to the documentation 
of [ioBroker.repositories](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#requirements-for-adapter-to-get-added-to-the-latest-repository).

### Test the adapter manually on a local ioBroker installation
In order to install the adapter locally without publishing, the following steps are recommended:
1. Create a tarball from your dev directory:  
    ```bash
    npm pack
    ```
1. Upload the resulting file to your ioBroker host
1. Install it locally (The paths are different on Windows):
    ```bash
    cd /opt/iobroker
    npm i /path/to/tarball.tgz
    ```

For later updates, the above procedure is not necessary. Just do the following:
1. Overwrite the changed files in the adapter directory (`/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.apsystems-ecu`)
1. Execute `iobroker upload apsystems-ecu` on the ioBroker host
