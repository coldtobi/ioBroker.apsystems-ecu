### Getting started

You are almost done, only a few steps left:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `ioBroker.apsystems-ecu`
1. Initialize the current folder as a new git repository:  
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
1. Link your local repository with the one on GitHub:  
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/npeter/ioBroker.apsystems-ecu
    ```

1. Push all files to the GitHub repo:  
    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```
1. Head over to [main.js](main.js) and start programming!

### Best Practices
We've collected some [best practices](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#development-and-coding-best-practices) regarding ioBroker development and coding in general. If you're new to ioBroker or Node.js, you should
check them out. If you're already experienced, you should also take a look at them - you might learn something new :)

### Scripts in `package.json`
Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `test:js`   | Executes the tests you defined in `*.test.js` files.     |
| `test:package`    | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files and your tests. |
| `lint` | Runs `ESLint` to check your code for formatting errors and potential bugs. |

### Writing tests
When done right, testing code is invaluable, because it gives you the 
confidence to change your code while knowing exactly if and when 
something breaks. A good read on the topic of test-driven development 
is https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92. 
Although writing tests before the code might seem strange at first, but it has very 
clear upsides.

The template provides you with basic tests for the adapter startup and package files.
It is recommended that you add your own tests into the mix.

### Publishing the adapter
Since you have chosen GitHub Actions as your CI service, you can 
enable automatic releases on npm whenever you push a new git tag that matches the form 
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. The necessary steps are described in `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`.

To get your adapter released in ioBroker, please refer to the documentation 
of [ioBroker.repositories](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#requirements-for-adapter-to-get-added-to-the-latest-repository).

### Test the adapter manually on a local ioBroker installation
In order to install the adapter locally without publishing, the following steps are recommended:
1. Create a tarball from your dev directory:  
    ```bash
    npm pack
    ```
1. Upload the resulting file to your ioBroker host
1. Install it locally (The paths are different on Windows):
    ```bash
    cd /opt/iobroker
    npm i /path/to/tarball.tgz
    ```

For later updates, the above procedure is not necessary. Just do the following:
1. Overwrite the changed files in the adapter directory (`/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.apsystems-ecu`)
1. Execute `iobroker upload apsystems-ecu` on the ioBroker host
